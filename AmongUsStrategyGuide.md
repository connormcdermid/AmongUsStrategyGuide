Among Us Strategy Guide

I. Introduction
	This guide will be organised into maps, with subsections for impostors and crewmates. There is also a general impostor and crewmate tips/strategies section. This guide is constantly in flux: new strategies will be added as they are invented.

II. General
1. Crewmate
	a) Complete your tasks as efficiently as possible. If there are multiple tasks in one area, do them all, then move onto the next area.
	
	b) Do not stack. Stacks of more than three people are easy for the impostor to infiltrate and stack-kill.

2. Impostor

	a) Stack kills: When there is a stack of three or more people, it is safe to join the stack and then press the kill button. One random member of the stack will be killed, and the person beneath them (not always you) will be revealed. Stack kills generally will be reported immediately, and as such will end the round, but will not reveal you.

	b) Drive-by kills: When you encounter a person alone heading in the opposite direction, and you are sure that either you are not followed or the person following you is unaware of you, you may kill them. The body will rarely be in a room, but instead in a hallway, so it will not show on the admin table, however many hallways are high-traffic areas, so be mindful of the time you have before the body is discovered, and develop an alibi.

	c) Vent kills: When you are certain someone is alone in a room, you may vent in, kill, and immediately vent out. This is a vent kill.

	d) Sabotages: Sabotages have different purposes. The Lights sabotage is useful to allow you to kill in a high-density group without being revealed. Reactor and Oxygen will draw players to one side of the map, allowing you to hide a body on the other side. The Doors sabotage, on applicable maps, will allow you to deny escape to someone you are chasing, deny access to the button if someone has seen you vent, or to deny access to a room to hide a body. Note that the Doors sabotage cooldown is independent of the Reactor, Oxygen, and Lights sabotage cooldowns – use this to your advantage.

	e) Faking Tasks: when a crewmate is observing you, it may be a good idea to fake a task. Simply approach a task and stand there for a while. If the crewmate is observant, it may be a good idea to wait until the task bar moves up before leaving the task so as not to seem suspicious, however keep in mind that waiting to long may be equally suspicious. Visual tasks are more difficult to be faked – however, if another crewmate is doing a task such as Weapons, you may stack on top of them and fake Weapons, or if you notice the weapons firing while nobody is there, a ghost may be doing the task: stand near and fake the task. Leave when the weapons stop firing.


III. The Skeld
1. Crewmate

	a) Electrical is a common killing ground, however contains many tasks. If you have tasks in electrical, it is recommended to complete them immediately upon entering the map while the Impostors are on their kill cooldown, then exit as fast as possible. When you pass by Electrical, make sure to enter occasionally to check if there is anyone there, and more importantly if there are any bodies.

	b) Visual Tasks: The following visual tasks appear on The Skeld:

    • Medbay: Submit Scan
    • Weapons: Clear Asteroids
    • Shields: Prime Shields
    • Storage: Empty Garbage
 
	     If you observe a crewmate complete one of these tasks, they are likely safe.

	c) Sabotages: If either Reactor or Oxygen is sabotaged, close the task you are doing and proceed immediately to repair them. If Lights is sabotaged, complete the task you are doing and proceed to Electrical to repair them. If there is someone near you, remain within vision radius. Doors on this map will open only after a timer – they cannot be opened manually. If Doors are closed in your way, attempt to go around.

	d) Common Tasks: The following tasks are common to The Skeld:

    • Admin: Swipe Card
    • Fix Wiring: wiring panels will be randomly selected.
      
	     

2. Impostor

	a) Electrical vent-kills: if someone is alone in Electrical, it is often safe to vent in and kill them. The vent in Electrical connects with Security and Medbay. However, Electrical is also high-traffic – expect the body to be discovered shortly, and move across the map. To prolong discovery, close the doors to Electrical and sabotage Oxygen.

	b) Sabotages: Oxygen will draw people to the right side of the map. Reactor will draw them to the left side. Use this to hide bodies on the opposite side of the map.

	c) Good Kill Locations: 
		Upper Cafeteria is rarely visited and often out of crewmates’ vision. Kills here may not be discovered for a significant amount of time.
		Electrical: while often visited, it is hidden from the view of passersby and generally secluded. Kills here should be easy, though they will be discovered quickly.
	Communications: Communications is rarely visited and can be quite secluded if crewmate vision is low. A good kill spot.
	Upper/Lower Reactor: anywhere at Reactor away from the main doors is a good kill spot, as the body cannot be seen from the hallway and there is little reason to go there other than the Reactor sabotage. However, this means it may be difficult to get kills there.
	Of course, drive-by kills are also excellent on this map, as are vent kills.
